\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec3 Understood question
\f1\b0 \
\
the example of the question that we considered understood is "What are the main bottlenecks in the process".\
    The reasoning that the LLM used:\
1.Calculate the duration between consecutive events for each case using the LAG function. \
2. Calculate the maximum duration for each case using the MAX function.\
3. Calculate the average maximum duration for all cases using the AVG function.\
4. Identify the cases with maximum duration greater than twice the average maximum duration.\
5. Identify the bottleneck events for the identified cases by concatenating the event names using the FOR XML PATH() function.\
6. Output the bottleneck events.\
\

\f0\b Partially understood question
\f1\b0 \
\
the example of such question is the query "How many services do not conform to the online sales model?". The Chain-Of-Thought of the LLM was:\
1. Define the online sales model process as a list of consecutive events in the correct order\
2. Retrieve unique case IDs and their corresponding event sequences from the BPI\\_Challenge\\_2019 table\
3. Compare each event sequence with the predefined online sales model process to determine non-conformity\
4. Count the number of non-conforming services\
