Question ID: 66
Question: Taking the main variant as basis, what are the main conformance problems?
Prompt: You are a skilled data analyst.  Your role is to explain which steps are needed in order to answer the question asked by user. The solution would be written in MS SQL and would query database in order to directly find the answer. Analyze the question and describe in multiply steps how MSSQL query should be built in order to answer the question.
The analyst is working on follwing data 
    The event_log data for the process is  stored in the table:BPI_Challenge_2019
    columns:['case_concept_name', 'event_concept_name', 'event_time_timestamp' ]
    column_types:['nvarchar', 'nvarchar','datetime2' ].
    In process mining, a case represents a single instance of a business process. 
    It has a unique ID and attributes like cycle time and costs. 
    Cases are used to analyze and improve processes .

    ID of a case is stored in case_concept_name column.
    Each case is composed of multiple events.
    An event name, and identifier, is stored in event_concept_name. 
    The time of execution of the event is stored in event_time_timestamp.
    Use minutes in datediff instead of seconds.
    Use the FOR XML PATH() function to concatenate values instead of STRING_AGG()

    If not additionaly specified task duration is a time duration between an event and consecutive event.
    bottleneck is expectionally long time between two events following each other. For description of bottleneck use event1 -> event2
    Use 2019-01-17 as today or current date , also use current date for this week, this weekend, today etc.

['main variant:    The main variant represents the most common sequence of activities that occur within a process. \n    It can be identified by analyzing the frequency of the different sequences of activities. \n    In BPI_Challenge_2019, it can be identified by analyzing the frequency of the different sequences of event_concept_name within a case (case_concept_name column).', '\n', 'conformance problems:    Conformance problems occur when there is a mismatch between the actual behavior of a process, as recorded in an event log like BPI_Challenge_2019, and the intended or ideal behavior of the process as modeled in a business process model.

Taking the main variant as basis, what are the main conformance problems?

Write an answer in following order 
STEPS:
here are the steps to acomplish the task. Do not add additional text or explenation outside of STEPS part. DO not add code outside of CODE part.

here should be an example MS SQL Query

DESCRIPTION:
here is a description and reasoning behind the above approach. 




----------------------------------RESPONSE OPEN AI: 

STEPS:
1. Identify the main variant by grouping the event_concept_name column by case_concept_name and ordering by count in descending order.
2. Get the sequence of events for the main variant by concatenating the event_concept_name column for each case_concept_name in the main variant using FOR XML PATH().
3. Join the BPI_Challenge_2019 table with itself on the condition that the case_concept_name is the same and the event_time_timestamp of the joined table is the minimum value greater than the event_time_timestamp of the original table.
4. Calculate the duration between the two events using DATEDIFF() function in minutes.
5. Filter the results to only include cases that follow the main variant sequence of events.
6. Group the results by the sequence of events and calculate the average duration between events.
7. Order the results by the average duration in descending order.
8. The main conformance problems are the sequences of events with the highest average duration between events.

CODE:
```
STEPS:
1. Identify the main variant by finding the most common sequence of events in the cases using the FOR XML PATH() function.
2. Compare the main variant with all other cases to identify any deviations.
3. Calculate the frequency of each deviation and rank them in descending order to find the main conformance problems.

CODE: 
```
WITH EventSequences AS (
    SELECT 
        case_concept_name, 
        (SELECT event_concept_name + '->' 
         FROM BPI_Challenge_2019 b2 
         WHERE b1.case_concept_name = b2.case_concept_name 
         ORDER BY event_time_timestamp 
         FOR XML PATH('')) AS event_sequence
    FROM BPI_Challenge_2019 b1
    GROUP BY case_concept_name
), SequenceCounts AS (
    SELECT event_sequence, COUNT(*) AS sequence_count
    FROM EventSequences
    GROUP BY event_sequence
), TopVariant AS (
    SELECT TOP 1 event_sequence
    FROM SequenceCounts
    ORDER BY sequence_count DESC
), ConformanceProblems AS (
    SELECT es.case_concept_name, es.event_sequence, tv.event_sequence AS main_variant,
           CASE WHEN es.event_sequence <> tv.event_sequence THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS deviation
    FROM EventSequences es
    CROSS JOIN TopVariant tv
), ProblemFrequency AS (
    SELECT deviation, COUNT(*) AS frequency
    FROM ConformanceProblems
    GROUP BY deviation
)
SELECT deviation, frequency
FROM ProblemFrequency
WHERE deviation = 1
ORDER BY frequency DESC;
```
DESCRIPTION:
The query starts by identifying the main variant by aggregating the event_concept_name in the order of event_time_timestamp for each case. This is done using the FOR XML PATH() function in the EventSequences CTE. Next, the frequency of each sequence is calculated in the SequenceCounts CTE. The top variant, which is the main variant, is then selected in the TopVariant CTE.

The ConformanceProblems CTE compares the main variant with all other cases to identify deviations. A deviation is marked as 1 if the sequence in a case is different from the main variant, and 0 otherwise. The ProblemFrequency CTE calculates the frequency of each deviation. Finally, the query selects deviations with a value of 1 and orders them by frequency in descending order to identify the main conformance problems.
----------------------------------Code: 


    WITH MainVariant AS (     SELECT TOP 1 case_concept_name, STRING_AGG(event_concept_name, '->') WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY event_time_timestamp) AS Sequence     FROM BPI_Challenge_2019     GROUP BY case_concept_name     ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC ), CasesWithSequences AS (     SELECT case_concept_name, STRING_AGG(event_concept_name, '->') WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY event_time_timestamp) AS Sequence     FROM BPI_Challenge_2019     GROUP BY case_concept_name ), Differences AS (     SELECT C.case_concept_name,            REPLACE(REPLACE(M.Sequence, C.Sequence, ''), '->->', '->') AS ConformanceProblem     FROM CasesWithSequences C     CROSS JOIN MainVariant M     WHERE C.Sequence <> M.Sequence ), ConformanceProblems AS (     SELECT case_concept_name, value AS Problem     FROM Differences     CROSS APPLY STRING_SPLIT(ConformanceProblem, '->')     WHERE value <> '' ) SELECT Problem, COUNT(*) AS Frequency FROM ConformanceProblems GROUP BY Problem ORDER BY Frequency DESC;
