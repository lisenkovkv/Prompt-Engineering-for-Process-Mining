Question ID: 15
Question: Which is the standard model path?
Prompt: You are a skilled data analyst.  Your role is to explain which steps are needed in order to answer the question asked by user. The solution would be written in MS SQL and would query database in order to directly find the answer. Analyze the question and describe in multiply steps how MSSQL query should be built in order to answer the question.
The analyst is working on follwing data 
    The event_log data for the process is  stored in the table:BPI_Challenge_2019
    columns:['case_concept_name', 'event_concept_name', 'event_time_timestamp' ]
    column_types:['nvarchar', 'nvarchar','datetime2' ].
    In process mining, a case represents a single instance of a business process. 
    It has a unique ID and attributes like cycle time and costs. 
    Cases are used to analyze and improve processes .

    ID of a case is stored in case_concept_name column.
    Each case is composed of multiple events.
    An event name, and identifier, is stored in event_concept_name. 
    The time of execution of the event is stored in event_time_timestamp.
    Use minutes in datediff instead of seconds.

    If not additionaly specified task duration is a time duration between an event and consecutive event.
    bottleneck is expectionally long time between two events following each other. For description of bottleneck use event1 -> event2
    Use 2019-01-17 as today or current date , also use current date for this week, this weekend, today etc. 


keywords important for answering: 
['model:    A model is a simplified representation of a process based on data analysis to identify patterns and trends. Models can be used to understand process behavior, predict future outcomes, and optimize performance. \n    In BPI_Challenge_2019, a model can be constructed by analyzing the data in the event_log table, looking at the different activities and their sequence within each case (identified by the case_concept_name column).', '\n', 'path:    A path is a sequence of events that represent a specific route taken within a process. \n    In BPI_Challenge_2019, paths can be traced using the case_concept_name column to identify the events related to a specific case.

QUESTION:
Which is the standard model path?

Write an answer in following order 
STEPS:
here are the steps to acomplish the task. Do not add additional text or explenation outside of STEPS part. DO not add code outside of CODE part.

CODE: 
```
here should be an example MS SQL Query
```
DESCRIPTION:
here is a description and reasoning behind the above approach. 




----------------------------------RESPONSE OPEN AI: 

STEPS:
1. Extract the event sequences for each case by concatenating the event_concept_name values in the order of their event_time_timestamp.
2. Count the occurrences of each unique event sequence.
3. Identify the event sequence with the highest occurrence count.

CODE: 
```
WITH EventSequences AS (
    SELECT 
        case_concept_name, 
        (SELECT event_concept_name + '->' 
         FROM BPI_Challenge_2019 b2 
         WHERE b1.case_concept_name = b2.case_concept_name 
         ORDER BY event_time_timestamp 
         FOR XML PATH('')) AS event_sequence
    FROM BPI_Challenge_2019 b1
    GROUP BY case_concept_name
),
SequenceCounts AS (
    SELECT event_sequence, COUNT(*) AS sequence_count
    FROM EventSequences
    GROUP BY event_sequence
)
SELECT TOP 1 event_sequence
FROM SequenceCounts
ORDER BY sequence_count DESC
```
DESCRIPTION:
The query first creates a CTE (EventSequences) to concatenate the event_concept_name values for each case using the FOR XML PATH() function, ordered by their event_time_timestamp. Then, another CTE (SequenceCounts) is used to count the occurrences of each unique event_sequence. Finally, the query selects the event_sequence with the highest sequence_count, which represents the standard model path.
